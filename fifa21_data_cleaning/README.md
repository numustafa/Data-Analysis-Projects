# Python Data Cleaning Project (FIFA 21)
This is a Basic Project for developing common data handelling and data manipulation skills in Pandas.

## Project Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for the data cleaning process of the FIFA21 dataset. The goal of this project is to clean and enhance the dataset which provides information about players in the popular FIFA21 video game. <br>

## Dataset Description
The FIFA 21 dataset used in this project was obtained from a data cleaning challenge on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring?select=fifa21+raw+data+v2.csv). It consists of player attributes, statistics and other relevant information.

The original FIFA21 dataset contains 18K+ records of player data. Each record represents a unique player and includes various attributes such as player name, age, nationality, club, overall rating and more.

### Issues with the dataset
During the initial exploration and analysis of the FIFA21 dataset, several issues were identified including:
* Missing values - 
* Inconsistent data types -

### Tools used:
* Python 
* Pandas - Data manipulation, analysis and cleaning
* Numpy - Array processing
* Jupyter Notebook - interactive development environment

## Project Structure
The Data Cleaning process involves:
* Data Exploration - The Dataset was throughly examined to identify issues and inconsistencies. The data does not have a data dictionary, so the data was explored manually. With the help of online sources I was able to create one that helped me gain an understanding of what all the columns represented, identify patterns and uncover anomalies
* Missing Values 
* Standardizing Formatting 
* Validation and Quality checks - The cleaned dataset underwent rigorous validation to ensure the quality, accuracy and integrity of the data.

## Conclusion
The cleaned dataset was exported as a CSV file and is available in the repository. The cleaned dataset can be used for further analysis and visualization.
