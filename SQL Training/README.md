A database is an organized collection of structured information, typically stored in the form of tables (rows & columns). Relational databases allow storing and retrieving different kinds of related information e.g. products, customers, and orders for an online shopping site. Structured Query Language or SQL (pronounced "sequel") is the most widely used language for interacting with relational databases, and is an essential skill for Data Science professionals.

The following topics are covered in this learning tutorial:

* Use cases and design of relational databases and SQL
* Setting up a database locally using MySQL server
* Creating, modifying and deleting databases and database tables
* SQL Data types and constraints (primary key, foreign key)
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on tables
* Exporting and importing data from relational databases
